# Casbin Code of Conduct

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This code of conduct applies to all of the projects under [the Casbin organization on GitHub](https://github.com/casbin), as well as all sub-organizations and the Casbin community at large (Gitter, Slack, QQ, etc.).

## How to use

The code of conduct is placed in a separate file. You can use it for any meetups, user groups, and other types of Casbin community events. Only need to pay attention to the following two points:

1. This code of conduct should be provided in the form of announcements or public documents/publications so that everyone can access and understand the relevant content.
2. The organizer's contact information should be provided so that community members can get help or report violations.

## How to contribute

If you have any suggestions for improving this code of conduct, please feel free to submit an issue or PR. We will review, discuss and merge changes as needed. Thank you.
